# Include this Makefile to compile an Arduino *.ino file on Linux or MacOS.
#
# Create a 'Makefile' in the sketch folder. For example, for the
# Blink/Blink.ino program, the makefile will be 'Blink/Makefile'.
# The content will look like this:
#
#      APP_NAME := {name of *.ino file}
#      ARDUINO_LIBS := AUnit AceTime {... additional Arduino libraries}
#      include ../../../EpoxyDuino/EpoxyDuino.mk
#
# The 2 required parameters are:
#
#   * APP_NAME
#       * Base name of the Arduino sketch file, e.g. 'Blink' not 'Blink.ino'
#   * ARDUINO_LIBS
#       * List of dependent Arduino libraries in sibling directories to
#         EpoxyDuino (e.g. AUnit).
#       * The EpoxyDuino directory is automatically included.
#
# Optional parameters are:
#
#    * ARDUINO_LIB_DIRS
#       * List of additional locations of Arduino libs
#       * For example, $(arduino_ide_dir)/libraries,
#         $(arduino_ide_dir)/hardware/arduino/avr/libraries,
#         $(arduino_ide_dir)/portable/packages/arduino/hardware/avr/1.8.2/libraries.
#       * (The $(arduino_ide_dir) is an example temporary variable containing
#         the install location of the Arduino IDE. It is not used by
#         EpoxyDuino.mk.)
#   * OBJS
#       * Additional object (*.o) files needed by the binary
#	* DEPS
#		* Additional source (*.h, *.cpp) files required by the final executable.
#		* These are additional source files which should trigger a recompile
#		  when they are modified.
#   * GENERATED
#       * A list of files which are generated by a script, and therefore can be
#          deleted by 'make clean'
#   * MORE_CLEAN
#       * Optional user-supplied make-target that performs additional cleanup
#          (i.e. removing generated files or directories).
#   * EPOXY_CORE
#       * The C macro to select a specific core. Valid options are:
#			* EPOXY_CORE_AVR (default)
#           * EPOXY_CORE_ESP8266
#	* EPOXY_CORE_PATH
#       * Select the alternate Core given by this full path.
#       * Default: $(EPOXY_DUINO_DIR)/cores/epoxy
#
# Type 'make -n' to verify.
#
# Type 'make' to create the $(APP_NAME).out program.
#
# Type 'make clean' to remove intermediate files.

# Compiler settings that depend on the OS (Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD). I'm not 100%
# sure that these flags are correct, but they seem to work. Previously, I was
# using just -Wall to catch the warnings, but some Arduino compilers seem to
# enable -Wextra when "enable warnings" is enabled. So let's add -Wextra in
# EpoxyDuino to help catch warnings on desktop machines as well.
#
# The difference between -stdlib=libstdc++ and -stdlib=libc++ seems to be that
# libstdc++ was created by the GNU team and libc++ was created by the LLVM
# team. Apple no longer distributes the latest version of the libstdc++, so we
# are forced to use libc++ on Macs.
#
# The Linux g++ flags came from looking at the verbose compiler output of the
# Arduino IDE. The g++ compiler automatically uses -stdlib=libstdc++. I copied
# the -fno-exceptions, -fno-threadsafe-statics, and -flto flags from the
# Arduino compiler output. But I'm not entirely sure that those flags are
# actually doing the right without linking to a version of the libstdc++ that
# was also compiled with the same flag. I don't know, things seem to work for
# now.
#
# The Mac clang++ flags came from... I can't remember. Some trial and error,
# and maybe this StackOverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19774778).
# It looks like the clang++ compiler supports the -std=gnu++11 flag, but I
# suspect that it requires using the latest libstdc++ library, which isn't
# available on Macs. So I'll be conservative and use just -std=c++11.
#
# The FreeBSD clang++ flags came from copying the Mac version, since it seems
# like c++ on FreeBSD is actualy clang++. It's possible that FreeBSD has the
# latest GNU version of libstdc++, but I'm not sure.
#
# The CFLAGS assume that any C files are C11 files (not C99) because my
# AceTimeC library requires C11. It may be possible to override that by passing
# the `-std=c99` flag in the EXTRA_CFLAGS variable (which overrides the
# `-std=c11` flag), but this has not been tested.
#
# I added EXTRA_CXXFLAGS and EXTRA_CFLAGS to allow end-user Makefiles to
# specify additional flags to CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS.
